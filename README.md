A News application which will serve you fresh news just out of the Box, completely Free of cost.


Application is based on React Framework.
Data is fetched from Newsapi.org using JS fetch API

The application is fully working but can't be deployed as API's developer plan doesn't allows me to! 😅

Additional Code added to handle issues with github single page applications =>
1) 404.html
2) script included in index.html
3) Browser Router used in index.js
4) Homepage address added in package.json
Can remove this code if not publishing on github pages.


Application will work fine in localhost, required API limit not exhausted (renewed daily)
